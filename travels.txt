Travel experience notes from Spain trip:
Two years ago I visited Spain, and this experience have been really cool and fun.
My first stop was on Madrid, is such a beautiful city full of history and good food, I spent a couple days exploring the downtown area and some local attractions.
My second stop was in Valencia, I had the opportunity to eat the original Paella, simply DELICIOUS !
And finally my last stop was Barcelona, in my my experience Barcelona is a city where the art is part of their life.
